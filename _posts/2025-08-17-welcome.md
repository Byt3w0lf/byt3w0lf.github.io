Hey 👋<br>
my name is **Wojciech "Byt3w0lf" Goska**, and at the time of writing, I am a .NET Developer with a total of 6 years of commercial experience.
I am also a proud father of an adorable two-year-old and the husband of a gorgeous medical student.


## Why this blog?

As my wife will soon graduate, I will have a chance to make some changes to my career plans, and that’s what this blog will be about.
I want to transition into something I used to do as a hobby for the past couple of months — the field of **Cybersecurity**, more precisely, its offensive side.
This seems like a tough shift, especially since I don’t want to start that career path from scratch, I simply can’t afford going back to being a Junior.
What I’ll be aiming for is a **Regular Pentester/Red Teamer** role, and to achieve that I’ve decided to follow a more structured way of learning than what I was doing before, which was mostly challenging **HTB** boxes, reading cybersec news, and attending conferences.
I will follow the **HTB Academy** **CPTS** certification path, after which I hope to pass the **CPTS** exam, and reach for the **OSCP**, as this is probably the most recognizable certificate - at least in HR circles.
After that, I’m considering either the **OSEP** or something strictly focused on **Windows Active Directory**. But for now that’s a song of the future, we’ll see how it all goes in a couple of months.


## What can you expect from this blog?

If everything goes according to plan, I’ll be posting:
- 💭 reflections I come up with along the way
- 📦 **HTB** box writeups
- 🛠️ custom tools I’ll be developing
- 📑 and probably some pentest reports
<br>
<br>

The idea is to use this blog both, to collect all the useful tools, tips, and tricks in one place (for myself and anyone interested), and to showcase my journey — use this blog as a kind of “business card” that proves I already have some hands-on **Cybersecurity** experience, even if it's not strictly commercial.<br>
It’s also something I hope will keep me motivated 🙂

Keep your fingers crossed,<br>
**Byt3w0lf**
