title: "Welcome to My Pentest Journey"

Hey, my name is Wojciech "Byt3w0lf" Goska, and at the time of writing, I am a .NET Developer with a total of 6 years of commercial experience.
I am also a proud father of an adorable two-year-old and the husband of a gorgeous medical student.


## Why this blog?

As my wife will soon graduate, I will have a chance to make some changes to my career plans, and that’s what this blog will be about.
I want to transition into something I used to do as a hobby for the past couple of months — the field of Cybersecurity, more precisely, its offensive side.
This seems like a tough shift, especially since I don’t want to start that career path from scratch, I simply can’t afford going back to being a Junior.
What I’ll be aiming for is a Regular Pentester/Red Teamer role, and to achieve that I’ve decided to follow a more structured way of learning than what I was doing before, which was mostly challenging HTB boxes, reading cybersec news, and attending conferences.
I will follow the HTB Academy CPTS certification path, after which I hope to pass the CPTS exam, and reach for the OSCP, as this is probably the most recognizable certificate - at least in HR circles.
After that, I’m considering either the OSEP or something strictly focused on Windows Active Directory. But for now that’s a song of the future, we’ll see how it all goes in a couple of months.


## What can you expect from this blog?

If everything goes according to plan, I’ll be posting:
- reflections I come up with along the way
- HTB box writeups
- custom tools I’ll be developing
- and probably some pentest reports
<br>
<br>

The idea is to use this blog both, to collect all the useful tools, tips, and tricks in one place (for myself and anyone interested), and to showcase my journey — using this blog as a kind of “business card” that proves I already have some hands-on Cybersecurity experience, even if not strictly commercial.<br>
It’s also something I hope will keep me motivated :)

Keep your fingers crossed,<br>
